# parse-xl
This is a simple Python script that reads an Excel spreadsheet using the xlrd library.
The script looks through the data for a given item (in this case, Pens).
For each instance of that item it finds, it grabs the count of items ordered, and the total cost of that order.
The result is a sum total of all the Pens ordered, and the total cost of those orders.
